## Gearbox

### notes
To smoothly mate gear teeth together the mate must have two leading edges either inside the tooth gap or on the leading edge of the gear's tooth. If one or more gears is already mated and another gear must be added, suppressing and unsupressing the mate will allow you to move the gear so the new mate will not clip into the existing mate and still work with the original mate. Also check gear thickness and spacer type if gears fail to allign on Z plane.

## Motion Study

### notes
Make sure that if an arm is to psuh somethin it will not be physiscaly bound to, that it does it smoothly and the arm itslef has room to make a full rotation or stops before colliding with anything. Gravity should always be checked, and the degree of the servo's rotation should be checked. Tangent mates are ideal.
